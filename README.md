# OpenAI Chatbot Project

Welcome to the OpenAI Chatbot Project! This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot using the OpenAI API, specifically the GPT-3.5 model. The chatbot is designed to engage in natural language conversations with users.

## Overview

This project showcases how to integrate the power of the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model into a chatbot application. The chatbot inputs user messages and generates coherent and contextually relevant responses. Conversations can be multi-turn, and the chatbot can understand and respond to user queries, statements, and more.


## To use it:
Set up your OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, sign up for an account at OpenAI and create an API key and replace it with "OPENAI_KEY" in the code.
Run the chatbot application and type in your query as the value of "content" key.
